This repository is a Krishna submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Files
CodeBook.md a code book that describes the work that I performed to clean the data

run_analysis.R runs 5 steps as described in the course project's definition:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TidyData.txt is the exported tidy data after going through all the sequences described above.
